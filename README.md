# REST-APIs-with-Flask-and-Python
Code from Section 6 and onwards of the REST APIs with Flask and Python course on Udemy. Section 10 code is excluded as it requires the purchase of a domain name.

The master branch is deployed on Heroku.

The code from [Section6/Local](https://github.com/bronson-c/REST-APIs-with-Flask-and-Python/tree/Section6/Local) can be run locally for testing purposes.
